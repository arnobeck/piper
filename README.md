# Piper [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gongled/piper)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gongled/piper)

`piper` is a tiny and ease-to-use utility for log rotation for [12-factor apps that write their logs to stdout](https://12factor.net/logs). 

## Purpose

`piper` solves these problems of logging design:

- It supports log rotation by USR1 [POSIX signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#POSIX_signals), in contrast to similar tools.
- It rotates logs for apps that do not support log rotation out-of-box.
- It rotates logs for apps that cannot be stopped for some reasons.
- It rotates logs for apps by given duration.
- It rotates logs for apps by given size limit.

## Installation

### From prebuilt package for RHEL7/CentOS7

```shell
[sudo] yum install -y http://yum.gongled.me/7/release/x86_64/gongled-release-7.4-0.el7.noarch.rpm
[sudo] yum install piper
```

### From the source code

Install dependencies using a Go package manager:

```shell
make deps
```

Build `piper`:

```shell
make all
```

## Getting started

Run `piper` to write stdin to `/var/log/program.log` file:

```
your_command_here | piper /var/log/program.log
```

Any output to stdout will be suppressed.
